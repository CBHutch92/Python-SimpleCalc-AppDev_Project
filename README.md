# About the Simple Calculator Project

# The code for this simple calculator project was written by me as part of the curriculum for my Application Development course (ITEC 2270).
# I received an A for this project

# 3/20/2025 This is the first update of what I hope is many updates to my former projects now that I have expanded my knowledge base and skills. The first change was to my simple calculator project. I decided to start from scratch with the "new" calculator, simplecalc_2.py, but I created a GUI to mimic dark mode and have created a .pyw file so that I can directly open the calculator without launching it via CMD.
